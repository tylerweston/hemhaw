## hemhaw
A Boggle/Scrabble/Sliding Puzzle mashup  

- Move letters around and make words from tiles that touch each other.  
- The tiles are scored based on Scrabble points and the Scrabble dictionary, with one bonus point given per letter used.  
- Stars are wildcards, use them as any letter. They aren't worth points, but they count towards word length.  
- You gain half a second for each point you get. How long can you play for?  
- There will be a new palette each time you play, if you don't like the current one click the top left of the window.
- Click and drag the mouse to select words. Release mouse button to select your word. If you want to deselect a word, drag you mouse off the grid.
